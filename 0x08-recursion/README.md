# C - Recursion

* All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* My code uses the Betty style to enhance readability and ease of maintenance. I checked my code using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* I did not use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etcâ€¦ is intentionally avoided. I created my _putchar() function to print to stdout.
* I also avoided the use of static or global variables and any kind of iterative programming such as for loops, while loops and do...while loops.
* The prototypes of all my functions and the prototype of the function _putchar are included in my header file called main.h.
